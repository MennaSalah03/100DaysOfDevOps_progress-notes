For Day 24, we have to branch out! We have to create a branch in a repo (the one from last day).

After navigating to the location of the repo, we can go about the task in 2 ways:

1. Creating with branch command
```bash
git branch [branch_name]
```
2. Creating with checkout (create + switch to it)
```bash
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```
