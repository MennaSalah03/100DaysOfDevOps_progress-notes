In this Repo, I am compiling all the knowledge I obtained from the 100 days of DevOps by KodeKloud. This is both as an accountability and for when I need to revise something I did in the challenge. It can also serve to help other people with some topics but not a great deal.

Each log of this will have an explanation of the task, my process, final result and also the resources that helped me to succeed in understanding doing the task.

PS: I got this idea on day 7 of the challenge, that's why it may have early logs empty. I intend to fill them eventually though.
