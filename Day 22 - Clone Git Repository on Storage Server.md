For this task, on the storage server, we have to clone a bare repo located on the machine at a path like `/opt/blog.git` to another location on the server.

Cloning a bare repository make working directory available so it can have more than metadata of the repo.

Cloning
```
cd /desired/repo/path
git clone /opt/blog.git
```
