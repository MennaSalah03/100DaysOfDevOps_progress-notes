The task was to make a pull request from a user account `max` and delegate reviewing the changes to another user `tom` to which you log in and then review the changes and merge to the master branch successfully.

This task was done via Gitea UI so there's not a lot to add to it.

1. Login to max account using given credentials.
2. There's already changes in the branches so apply for a pull request directly with a message indicating the changes e.g.`added new story`.
3. Add a reviewer after applying to be another user `tom`.
4. Log in to `tom` and review, comment and commit the changes.
