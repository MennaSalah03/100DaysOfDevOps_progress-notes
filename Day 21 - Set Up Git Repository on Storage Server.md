This task is the first in Git tasks. We have to install Git on the storage server, and make a bare repository called `blog.git` in a directory `/opt/`. repos ending in `.git` is a bare repository

A bare repository doesn't have a working directory, so git commands won't work.

To install Git
```bash
yum install -y git
```

Creating bare repo.
```bash
cd /opt
git initÂ  --bare blog.git
```
